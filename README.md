Simple OBS script intended to give credit for whatever song you use on your streaming and display said credit in a text font of your choice.

Let it be noted that, in its current state, the script considers the name of the file said credit. Therefore, in order to give proper credit, the file must be named/renamed so that it displays the name of the song and the author.
